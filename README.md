# Pet Project - Dashboard with Dash

## Why?
I wanted to try to use the Dash framework for creating dashboards. I wondered about trying some extra interesting tools, not only as examples from documentation. 

## Tools
- Python
- Dash
- Git
- Dash-bootstrap-components

	- Try to use Poetry
	- Use Docker for deploying
